# Collaboration

## Note Taking

- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) - Open Source, uses mark down files. Mobile
  support.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Wiki stored in markdown files locally.
  Not open source though.
- [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) - Haven't tried
- [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) - Wiki contained in one file,
  customizable. I use
  [TiddlyDesktop](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop/releases) for
  saving.
  - [Backlinks in
    TiddlyWiki](https://lesser.occult.institute/an-opinionated-approach-to-tiddlywiki)
- [Bear](https://bear.app/) - Notes on iOS and MacOS
- Org Mode - Emacs feature.
  - org-roam: Roam addon.
- "Logbook" Script - Simple bash script to edit a file with today's date as
  the name.
- Simple Note
- ResophNotes (Windows): Simplenote client
- [Neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/) - CLI Zettelkasten - Seems too
  complicated. Requires NIX.

### Online / Paid

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) - Online service, structured and super
  customizable
- [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) - Online Service, Wiki + Backlinks and
  other innovative features

### Theory

- [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)
- No Org: writing one giant append-only markdown file per project. Search for
  the thing you want and it usually comes up. Notes have a timestamp and
  they're in order.
